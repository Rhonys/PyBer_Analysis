# Overview of the analysis:
This analysis is intended to visualize the ride share data for Pyber, a ride sharing company. The data includes the total rides, drivers, fares, and average fare broken down by city type. 
# Results
This is the breakdown of the ride data. The data shows that even though the fares are lower in Urban areas, the volume equals a higher overall revenue. As the city-type changes and the total rides / drivers decreases, the average price of the fare per ride or driver also increases.

# Summary
As indicated by the results of the analysis above, the total fares for the Rural and Suburban markets are considerably lower than in the Urban markets. Here are a few recommendations to increase revenue.

- Decrease the cost of rides in the Suburban and Rural markets to encourage more rides overall.
- Increase the amount of drivers in the Suburban and Rural markets to reduce wait time. This should also increase the amount of rides in these markets.
- Increase the cost of rides in the Urban market to maximize revenue and meet the demand of the market.
